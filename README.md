# Void-install

A very simple and noobish automatic Void Linux installation script.

This script is intended for people that have some Linux knowledge and experience.

It is not a script that lets you select what you want to install, you will have to modify it for your needs.

See it as a template for you to make your own script.

Run it from /run/initramfs/live/ after moving it to the root of USB or ISO or mount the partition where the script is located and run it from there.

Run with sh arch-install.sh, add -x switch for verbose/debugging.

The script automatically wipes the disk so be careful to not wipe the wrong disk and make sure to have a backup.

This script is written for unofficial ISO (https://voidbuilds.xyz/). It is fully safe to use, updated and overall better than the official one.
